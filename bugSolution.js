The provided solution focuses on ensuring the Android SDK is properly installed and configured.  This involves checking for the presence of the required build-tools and platform-tools and updating or reinstalling them as needed.  It may also involve confirming that environment variables are correctly set to point to the Android SDK installation.

Specific steps:

1. **Check SDK Manager:** Open the Android SDK Manager (usually accessible through Android Studio or the SDK Command-line tools) and ensure that the necessary build-tools and platform-tools are installed. Update to the latest versions if available.
2. **Repair SDK:** If issues persist, consider repairing the entire Android SDK installation. This often resolves inconsistencies.
3. **Environment Variables:** Verify that your `ANDROID_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables are properly configured to include the location of your Android SDK.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** After performing the above steps, run `expo prebuild` again to attempt a clean build. 
5. **Restart your computer:**  Occasionally, restarting your computer after SDK updates can clear the cache and help the changes take effect.
